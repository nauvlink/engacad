			<h1>Web <br>Development.</h1>
			<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.</p>
			<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used for the presentation of Web pages, including colors, formats, and fonts. </p>
			<p>Github is a coding platform where people can collaborate on projects and host websites.</p>
			<p> <br> My Experience: <br> Web Development is really challenging at first but I soon realize that making websites is fun thing. <br> The End Product will make me feel Accomplished and Satisfied.</p>
			<p>At first, the lack of Html and CSS knowledge really chained me back from progressing but i found ways of overcoming it.</p>
			<p>I didn't even know how to create a header and footer. I was a Newbie.</p>
			<p>One of which is that i watch youtube tutorials on it. Personally recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE">Jake Wright's</a> fast and easy tutorials.</p>
			<p>Another way is that <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp">w3schools.com</a> helped me solve CSS problems like how to change the font size or margin. </p>
